Between 2007 and 2010, I created four different random map templates
for Battle for Wesnoth: Forest, Palm, Tropical, and Huge. I have finally
put these maps in a proper Wesnoth add-on.

*   Forest is a random map template I made in 2007; it is now in a proper 
    add-on. This template has far fewer trees than the Forest template in 
    Ultimate Random Maps.

*   Palm, which makes randomly generated desert maps with lots of palm trees.

*   Tropical, which makes desert maps tweaked to have more palm trees,
    roads, more water, and less sand. Feels somewhat like a swamp with so
    much water and palm trees everywhere.

*   Huge, which makes huge 250x250 9-player random generated maps. Be
    warned: It takes some time to make these maps, so if you select this
    random template, Wesnoth will freeze for a few seconds while it generates
    a huge map.


In addition to being able to download this at the official Battle for
Wesnoth add-on server (add-ons.wesnoth.org) as a Wesnoth 1.12 addon,
itâ€™s also possible to view the files in the following locations:

*   http://samiam.org/wesnoth/
*   https://github.com/samboy/SamsRandomMaps


I would like to thank SigurdFireDragon, whose Ultimate Random Maps add-on
I used to figure out how to finally make these templates a proper Wesnoth
addon, and the Wesnoth development team for making such a fine GPL turn
based strategy game.

Bug reports, feedback, and suggestions are welcome, but it is unlikely
I will have the time to implement new features.

Note that the passphrase in _server.pbl is not the real one (but it
is one which gives me enough information to make the real one).
